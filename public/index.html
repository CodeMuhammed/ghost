		  <p>In our society today, there are a lots of ways to make money but when classified into a more generalized spectrum, falls in either of the two categories --selling products or offering services. If you intend to run a successful business on-line, then product marketing is the best way to do it,with affiliate marketing being the best way to start. Here are some advantages.</p>
		  
		  <h3>Its always a pleasure to be a beta tester</h3>
		  <p>Albeit the claims form professional about how easy affiliate marketing is, that is far from being true which is reflected in the steep leaning curve. The success of your business will depend on how fast you are able to get over that curve, and whether or not your business model is viable enough to
		  get over its initial stages.Chances are that you have a long-term busi
		  ness venture in mind, something that you would love to spend every day
		  doing. Do you really want to risk the viability (and fun) of that idea by
		  erately trying to make it work? Of course not! Affiliate marketing allows 
		  you to learn the ropes with other products and niches, protecting your big idea.</p>
		  <h3>Group validation takes away the doubt</h3><p>Everyone has something that they are passionate about. You may not realize it, but the things that you like, no matter what they are, can be turned into a 
		  viable business. You just have to be able to find the market within your passion and figure out what products
		  this market is willing to buy on-line.Affiliate marketing allows you to interact
		  with other product creators effectively, thereby sharing ideas, skills and most important of all alleviating you
		  of any doubt about how valid your business idea is. With the knowledge gained over time, decide to create 
		  something incredibly big becomes really easy.<br></p>

		  <h3>Innovation is all about diversity</h3>
		  <p>Over 75% of new business barely makes it past their third year.The statistics are even more crippling for start-ups. Paraphrasing the renowned co-founder of y-combinator- Paul Graham ,\"if you can just escape dying, you succeed\" . As it turns out the reason for this massive failure is not because the land scape is too harsh or not convenient for doing business, it just so happens that most new business owners are not prepared well enough educationally and experience wise. The world of affiliate marketing is not an exception to the above rules.The good news is that education-wise there are lots of great resources out there for you to devour its just a mater of knowing where to look. As for experience being a significant factor, is left for time itself to prove right or wrong.</p>
