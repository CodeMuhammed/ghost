		  <h3>Innovation is all about diversity</h3><p>Over 75% of new business barely makes it past their third year.The statistics are even more crippling for start-ups. Paraphrasing the renowned co-founder of y-combinator- Paul Graham ,\"if you can just escape dying, you succeed\" . As it turns out the reason for this massive failure is not because the land scape is too harsh or not convenient for doing business, it just so happens that most new business owners are not prepared well enough educationally and experience wise. The world of affiliate marketing is not an exception to the above rules.The good news is that education-wise there are lots of great resources out there for you to devour its just a mater of knowing where to look. As for experience being a significant factor, is left for time itself to prove right or wrong.</p>
